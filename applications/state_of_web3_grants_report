# State of Web3 Grants

## Project Overview 

### Overview

Please provide the following:

#### Problem
Grant programs in web3 play an interesting role in the space. At their core, most programs are intended to support the overall growth of the specific ecosystem they exist within (e.g. the Ethereum Foundation’s grant program is meant to grow Ethereum broadly, Aave’s program is meant to grow Aave, etc.). That’s not to say these grants are myopically focused on short-term ecosystem growth at the expense of long-term success. Quite the contrary, some programs are inspired by foundation or other long-term focused funding/giving models. However, many programs have struggled with various elements such as what to focus giving grants on, who should be reviewing grants, how to best assess grants once issued, etc. 

#### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to do a review of and to produce both a report on the current state of grant programs in the web3 space. This would entail: producing a list of active grant programs as of Q1 2023, conducting interviews and running surveys with those who both structured/ran the programs or applied for/received grants from them, writing a report on the current state of grants in web3, and creating a podcast mini-series on the topic.

Grants programs to assess will include: Aave, Algorand, Aragon, BitDAO, Cardano, Celo, Chainlink, Consensys, Ethereum Foundation, NEAR, Ocean Protocol, Optimism, PolygonDAO, Protocol Labs, Radicle, Safe DAO, Solana, Uniswap, and Web3 Foundation, amongst others. 

This relates to the Web3 Foundations overall ecosystem as W3F is one of the longer standing grant programs and would be an important one to capture as part of this report. 

### Project Details

Questions to explore and compare will include: volume of grants (quantity, funds), team size, review process, number of reviewers, post issuance process, general operations structure, focus of grants, as well as the user experience of applying for and receiving the grants. It is important to explore the journey of users as part of this research to better understand the perceived desire and impact from the perspective of those applying for grants.

In order to gain the right level of insight, a series of surveys and interviews will be conducted with at least 50-75+ individuals. These interviews will explore how the grant programs were created, structured, managed, and what kind of impact they have had. 

In addition to this information, larger scale surveys and data gathering will take place in order to conduct some analysis across grant programs and to provide some learnings for the space. A report will then be written, bringing together the results of the surveys and analysis, along with any other potential suggestions for how to improve the state of grants in web3. This report will provide a history of grant programs in web3, highlight common and best practices, share any data that was collected, and provide both open questions and potential solutions. 

If enough funds are raised, a podcast will be created to supplement the report. By creating a mini-series composed of some highlights of interviews and takeaways from the report, this project will output an accessible overview of the findings. 
Elements to Explore
Below is a list of elements to explore for each grant program. This is not an exhaustive list and is intended to give a general sense of the specific questions that will be asked. The surveys are currently being developed and more detail can be provided as needed. 

History of grant programs and how they came together 
- When was the program first conceived and by whom 
- What examples were looked to when structuring the grant program 
- What was the desired impact?
- Was there a grant lead and who decided on that person?
- How was the initial grant budget decided? 
- When was the grant program ‘launched’? What did launch entail? When was the first grant application received? 
- Who reviewed the first grant(s)?
Nature of the operations of grant programs
- How many grants issued to date (including size and focus, ideally) 
- How many people are on the grants team, both part-time and full-time? If there’s no dedicated team, how many people support the program?
- How many people review each grant? How do you source these reviewers? 
- Is there a component of community review / voting? 
- Are grants decisions on-chain? If yes, does that trigger payout or signal for someone else to payout? If the latter, who has control over the treasury?
Impact of grant programs 
- Is there a measure of impact already used in the ecosystem? 
- Is there some overly simplistic breakdown of ‘was this grant impactful or not’? 
- How many were product / development focus vs other? 
Experience going through grant programs 
- How many grants did you apply to across how many ecosystems? 
- How hard was it to find grants?
- How hard was it to apply?
- How long did it take to hear back?
- How much communication and feedback did you get?
- How much did you receive in funding? 
Select non-web3 grant programs to explore
- Explore the grant programs that are being run by Experiment Foundation, Speculative Technologies, Artizen Fund, Big Green DAO, etc. 
- How grant programs in web3 compare to overall grant programs 
- Landscape of funding that research orgs apply for 
How can grant programs improve 
- Synthesize best practices 

### Ecosystem Fit

This project fits into the ecosystem as there have been grants issued for quite some time. As such, the current bear market during which many programs are reviewing their impact is a perfect time to review the programs across the space, including the Web3 Foundation program.

## Development Status 

This is a new project and the first two milestones outlined below are already in process. 

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

The first milestone revolves around mapping grant programs in the space and providing a clear way for others to learn about active grant programs with more insights relative to a tool such as https://blockworks.co/grants. Progress has already started on this milestone. 

The second milestone will revolve around developing two surveys: one for those running/building grant programs and one for those who have applied to grant programs. Progress has already started on this milestone. 

The third milestone will involve deploying aforementioned surveys to as many individuals as possible, with an initial focus on getting as many core contributors to major grant programs to fill out the survey as possible. This milestone will take at least 2 months, as it will also entail running 50+ hours of one on one interviews as well as deploying the survey at scale. 

The fourth milestone will entail analyzing the data from the third milestone and synthesizing results into a series of blog posts (at least 1) and a longer report. 

A potential fifth milestone will involve producing a podcast from the captured interviews and releasing it in order to provide an audio-based alternative to reading the report. 

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Approximately 4-6 months depending on interview scheduling and volume of survey responses 
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  1.5-2 
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project is $10,000 from the Web3 Foundation, with a total ask of $50,000 across multiple organizations. 

The main costs for this project will be labor, with some additional costs around travel, equipment rental, and marketing related expenses. The roles required for this project include, at a minimum:
Lead researcher(s) 
Research assistants 
Audio/video editor (if enough funds are raised for a podcast)

We are starting out by seeking a total budget of $50,000 total. This will cover the labor hours on a general survey of grant programs as well as a more comprehensive deep dive for the larger organizations that are able to cover the larger grant size. 

## Future Plans

I am starting to reach out to all of the top grant programs in the space. As part of this, I will be building a community of grant program operators/leaders to help increase coordination amongst progarms in the future. The community will continue beyond the generation of this report. 

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

A number of other individuals and groups in the space have expressed interest in collaborating with me on both the research and potential redesign of grant programs, including core contributors from Gitcoin, TalentDAO, Deep Work, and RnDAO. 

I am also applying to grants from Ethereum Foundation, Uniswap Foundation, Aave, and other long-standing programs in the space.
